# Senior-Project

For this project, I explore the topic of lexical simplification and create four basic simplification models. The framework for these models is
sourced from a survey titled "A Survey on Lexical Simplification" by G. H. Paetzold and L. Specia. I do make tweaks to the framework for
simplicity and clarity. For specific information about methodology, results, and analysis, please refer to the paper included in this repository:
**[Dumonym: Crafting and Assessing Lexical Simplification, from algorithms to models](Dym.pdf)**

**Pipeline**
- Complex Word Identfication: identifies words as complex from a given sentence
- Substitution Generation: generates synonyms or alternatives for each word in a given list of complex words
- Substitution Ranking: ranks which substitute terms are most appropriate from a given list of alternative terms
- Substitution Replacement: replaces identified complex words with alternatives

Each model follows this pipeline with distinct aspects to improve quality.
